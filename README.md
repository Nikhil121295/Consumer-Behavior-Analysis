# Consumer-Behavior-Analysis

This project focuses on understanding consumer shopping habits using transactional data from an e-commerce platform. By applying clustering techniques and exploratory data analysis in Python, the goal was to identify key customer segments based on behavior patterns such as purchase frequency, product preferences, and recency. The insights can be leveraged to personalize marketing strategies, optimize retention efforts, and drive business growth through targeted campaigns.
